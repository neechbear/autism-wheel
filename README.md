# Autism wheel

This tool has been a personal experiment in vibe-coding to see what is possible
without writing a single line of code, and without providing any technical
programming guidance in the creation of the application. The future is going to
be incredible! :-D

## Building

Run `make` to see a list of available targets.

Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.

Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.

```console
npx playwright install --with-deps
npm run build
npm playwright test
npm test
```
